# smartAir
Hi, I am a student Multimedia & Communication Technology at Howest. To show what I learned this year I made a Smart Air Purifier. I made this project because a lot of people have bad in house air quality. Bad air quality can cause headaches, sneezing, couching and many more health issues. 'SmartAir' wil help you become aware of this problem and even help you to improve in house air quality.
